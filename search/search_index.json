Naturally forming in pockets and geodes near the Continental Crystal, Greater Crystals are often mined by the ruling government as trade goods, and can go for large sums of money in the right market.  Many independent mercantile airships  make their money shuffling Greater Crystals around Arcadia, selling a crystal from far away and buying local crystals with some of the profits, before moving on to wherever they think they can get the best price for their newly purchased goods.</p> <p>A particularly large Greater Crystal can form the core of an Airship's lift enchantment.

The magic of the Elemental Crystal keeps them afloat with every minimal maintenance, and most ships have secondary sails or propulsion methods to get to a port in case of emergency.

In short, neither of us, in this case, are particularly imaginative.  Arcadia, as a name for a place, is recorded as far back as the 3rd century BCE by the ancient Greeks.  The names are an unfortunate collision, but it's far too late for me to change it now, it's forever Arcadia to me.  My Arcadia setting is a riff of numerous ideas and themes stolen from several pieces of media, but most strongly, Skies of Arcadia, a JRPG released for the Dreamcast in 2000, and republished for the Gamecube in 2002.  Further inspirations are listed at the bottom of the page.</p> <p>This setting was first played in late 2019, in a DND5e game that would last until early 2022, and the system I built the setting for was a strong influence in the worldbuilding and structure of the world.
