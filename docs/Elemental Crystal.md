The phrase "Elemental Crystal" refers to a magically infused crystalline object that radiates strongly in a single element.  Each crystal has unique properties and uses, depending on the color, grade, and size of crystal.  In general, using the magical effects of a crystal will eventually result in a Dun Crystal, which is inert and largely useless.

## Continental Crystal
A continental crystal is the largest form of crystal, formed of hundreds of cubic kilometers of uniform crystal.  These sit at the center of the continent-islands of Arcadia, and provide the magical force that keeps the continents floating above the [[Void Below]].  In almost all civilized places, mining or removing chunks from the Continental Crystal is a grave crime, as it risks the stability of the entire continent.  Nevertheless, the value of such pure crystal, easily available, is a tempting target for those in need of quick money and with loose scruples.

## Greater Crystal
A greater crystal is one that is large enough to be difficult to carry by hand.  Naturally forming in pockets and geodes near the Continental Crystal, Greater Crystals are often mined by the ruling government as trade goods, and can go for large sums of money in the right market.  Many independent mercantile airships  make their money shuffling Greater Crystals around Arcadia, selling a crystal from far away and buying local crystals with some of the profits, before moving on to wherever they think they can get the best price for their newly purchased goods.

A particularly large Greater Crystal can form the core of an [[Airship]]'s lift enchantment.  In this use, thankfully, a crystal does not discharge over time.

## Lesser Crystal
Small enough to hold in hand, these crystals can rarely be found simply lying around in sufficiently untraveled areas.  More often, a Greater Crystal is processed into a large number of Lesser Crystals for use by individuals to power artifice, magical items, or as reagents in various spells and rituals.

## Dun Crystal
A crystal which has been drained of it's inherent magic turns to a crumbly, chalk-like grey stone.  The crushed crystal can be further used in some rare situations, but often a Dun Crystal is simply discarded.
