First of all, you'll note that this setting's name has been used by Matt Colville before.  In short, neither of us, in this case, are particularly imaginative.  Arcadia, as a name for a place, is recorded as far back as the 3rd century BCE by the ancient Greeks.  The names are an unfortunate collision, but it's far too late for me to change it now, it's forever Arcadia to me.  My Arcadia setting is a riff of numerous ideas and themes stolen from several pieces of media, but most strongly, Skies of Arcadia, a JRPG released for the Dreamcast in 2000, and republished for the Gamecube in 2002.  Further inspirations are listed at the bottom of the page.

This setting was first played in late 2019, in a DND5e game that would last until early 2022, and the system I built the setting for was a strong influence in the worldbuilding and structure of the world.  Moving to Draw Steel has not been entirely without issue.

### Locations and Elements
5e has ten "elemental" damage types - Acid, Lightning, Poison, Force, Fire, Ice, Necrotic, Radiant, Thunder, and Psychic.  Each of these types became a continent in the initial design.  Draw steel has only nine, leaving one of my initial continents without an equivalent.  Otherwise, the damage types are the same, or reasonably equivalent (Radiant->Holy, Necrotic->Corruption)

[[Xelsoan]], the continent previously associated with Force damage had no obvious equivalent.  The lore of the location already had a connection to gravity and manipulation of fundamental forces, so Xelsoan loses it's "damage type", but keeps the flavor.

### People
Several "races" do not have equivalent "ancestries".  In particular, Tabaxi, which were fairly prominent in the initial game.  Tabaxi - [[Catfolk]] will remain in the setting.  If a player desires to play one, we'll find some homebrew and make it work.

The flavor of various ancestries in Draw Steel has also changed to better fit this setting as I had imagined it. Most notably, [[Polder]] are not as integrated into human society as indicated in the book (but instead with Dwarves), and [[Revenant]]s have a second way to come into being, a ritual perfected by the high elves of [[Thellonde]].

### Previous Events
The [[100-hours war]] was the climax of the long campaign where this setting was first used.   the players confronted an Elder Brain in the Hollows, triggering the long-running plans of the BBEG, which had taken
