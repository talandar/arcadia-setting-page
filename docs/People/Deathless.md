The Deathless are, in many respects, extremely similar to the [[Revenant]] (using the Revenant rules for character creation).  However, rather than being brought back "through a
combination of an unjust death and a burning desire for vengeance", the Deathless are brought back through well-understood (though largely secret) ritual.

The ritual to create a deathless is held closely by the noble families of [[Thellonde]].  They have, thus far, kept the number of non-Thell Deathless to a very small number, though careful decision of who is allowed to understand the ritual, and perhaps some more underhanded means.

### Differences
The prime difference between a Deathless and a naturally-formed Revenant is the  requirement for a Deathless to hold a small sliver of black [[Elemental Crystal]] on their person at all times.  Without this, a Deathless will slowly lose the animating energy keeping it going.  After some time, usually weeks to months, depending on the particular Deathless, the individual will fall unconscious.  In this state, a Deathless does not perceive the flow of time, and rests as if a perfectly preserved corpse, until a new shard of black crystal is brought to them.  A comatose Deathless that is given a shard of black crystal wakes within a few days, returning to peak form as if their animating force had never been missing.
