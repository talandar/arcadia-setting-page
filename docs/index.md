The world of Arcadia is made up of islands that float in the air.  The islands are suspended in midair by powerful [[Elemental Crystal]]s that lie at the core of the land.  These elemental crystals infuse the islands, affecting the people, climate, and resources available there.  There are ten elementally influenced areas, though the forces at play mean that not all have people living on them.

First, an [[above the table note]] on the setting.  Not required reading, but may be helpful for understanding why the setting is how it is.

This is a work in progress.  Anytime you see pairs of brackets with text in them `[[Page Name]]` that is an unfinished page that will hopefully appear soon.

Arcadia has a reasonably deep [[Arcadian Timeline|Timeline]] of events, and a simple [[Arcadian Calendar|Calendar System]].

## The Floating Continents
Ten large floating continents hover over a [[Void Below]], each elementally charged.  [[Airship]]s are the only way of travel between continents.
### [[Acid Wastes]]
- **Element**: Acid
- **Associated Color**: Purple
- **People:** None
- **Terrain:** Blasted rock, acid pools  
- **Government:** None


The acid wastes are an extremely inhospitable rocky plains, with pools of acidic water fed by frequent acid rains.  Clouds of toxic gas rise from the rock at random, and monsters stalk the terrain, looking for food.  The only sign of civilization here is an ancient, magically-reinforced abandoned penitentiary on the northern coast that no extant nation takes credit for. 

### [[Brunhild]]
- **Element**: Lightning
- **Associated Color**: Yellow
- **People:** Dwarf, Polder 
- **Terrain:** Mountainous, rough (settlements are uniformly subterranean)  
- **Government:** Multi-Level Elected Representative councils 

Brunhild is a prosperous, technologically advanced country that thrives under near-constant lightning storms.  A few hundred years ago, the people here found a way to harness the lightning and use it to power immensely complicated machines and weapons.  This drove a technological revolution here - nearly limitless free energy allowed an amazingly rapid industrialization of most manual labor, allowing a generation of tinkerers and inventors to spring up.  For safety, the people here primarily live in large excavated cave systems, strongholds carved from the mountains and made into beautiful, strong homes.

### [[Celestia]]
- **Element**: Holy
- **Associated Color**: White
- **People:** Very diverse, humans most common.  
- **Terrain:** Grasslands, Woodlands  
- **Government:** in flux

Celestia is the country of the gods and of religion. One of the more metropolitan countries, people of all types live here, including what many would term the "monstrous" races.  Currently in the midst of a revolution, the political situation, especially in the capital, is tenuous. People here live primarily in wattle and daub houses, though stone or log houses are not uncommon in the wilds.

### [[Frostlands]] 
- **Element**: Cold
- **Associated Color**: Blue
- **People:** Dragon Knight, Hakaan  
- **Terrain:** Tundra, Glacier, Ice
- **Government:** Tribal, loosely associated

The frostlands are made up of not so much islands as glaciers or icebergs.  The blue icy elemental crystal causes nearly constant snowfall in the frostlands, snow that almost never melts.  This accumulation requires the people of these lands to have to take significant action in order to keep from being inundated.  Only recently have the tribes of the frostlands began unifying under the banner of one [[Hadren Greyscale]], a Dragon Knight of advanced age and wisdom.  Homes and buildings in the Frostlands are primarily wooden construction, with leather or hide wrappings to keep the heat in.

### [[Hollows]]
- **Element**: Psychic
- **Associated Color**: Orange
- **People:** Varied
- **Terrain:** Rolling Hills, Ruined Metropolis
- **Government:** None

Until very recently, The Hollows was largely inaccessible due to a persistent psychic storm that blanketed the area influenced by the Orange crystal.  This effect, it turned out, was due to an eldritch monstrosity that had taken the area as a lair.  At the end of the [[100-hours war]], the death of the monstrosity ended the storm.  The repercussions of the war and the monstrosity are still being felt here, but the previously isolated population is recovering, and the location is a favorite for researchers and adventurers.

### [[Pyrrhus]]
- **Element**: Fire
- **Associated Color**: Red
- **People:** Human, Dwarf
- **Terrain:** Desert, Mountains
- **Government:** Hereditary Monarchy

Pyrrhus is a mountainous, desert island with a large, active volcano at the center.  The mountainous terrain has significant metal and [[firestone]] deposits, and is prosperous as a result.  Pyrrhus suffered most after the [[100-hours war]], when many of the top politicians and buracrats were revealed to have been under control of the Abomination from the hollows.  The new king, thankfully, is well liked and was spared any blowback from his father's corruption.  Most buildings in Pyrrhus are of mud brick or mortared stone, for insulation from the desert heat.

### [[Silvius]]
- **Element**: Poison
- **Associated Color**: Green
- **People:** Wode Elves
- **Terrain:** Dense Forest
- **Government:** Constitutionally Limited Monarchy

Silvius is a dense jungle, full of predatory animals, poisonous and carnivorous plants, and a thriving society of wode elves. The crystal powering Silvius taints the land with poison, requiring innovative farming techniques from the Silvian People to produce safe food. It is here that [[floatwood]], a light, strong material used mainly in airship construction is found in great quantities, giving Silvius a strong trade position and relatively powerful navy. The people here live in tree houses above the jungle floor, in great cities connected by bridges and ladders.
### [[Thellonde]]
- **Element**: Corruption
- **Associated Color**: Black
- **People:** High Elves
- **Terrain:** Grasslands, Forests
- **Government:** Monarchy

Thellonde is a powerful elvish kingdom that lives in a land where the dead occasionally rise from their graves if not properly handled. The people here are known as skilled craftsmen and artists, using their long lives to perfect their crafts. Thellonde claims to have "conquered death", with the ritual that allows them to raise the honored dead as [[deathless]]. These deathless retain their personality and selves, but do not age. Thellonde can raise a significant army at a moments notice though the use of these deathless, making them possibly the most militarily powerful nation in Arcadia.

### [[The Thundering Storm]]
- **Element**: Sonic
- **Associated Color**: Clear
- **People:** None
- **Terrain:** Small islands, rocky
- **Government:** None

The Thundering Storm is a vast area of cyclones, high winds, flying debris, and other dangers. There are a few settlement worthy islands on the borders of the Storm, and they are almost all populated by pirates, brigands, and other lowlifes. No country claims the thundering storm, as even if there were valuable resources here, it would be difficult to extract them.  There was once a continent and powerful empire here, before the [[Calamity Event]] changed things.

### [[Xelsoan]]
- **Element**: Gravity, Force
- **Associated Color**: Silver
- **People:** Varied
- **Terrain:** Plains, Hills, Mountains
- **Government:** Representative Democracy

A quirk of physics caused by the elemental crystal at the center of Xelsoan allows the people here to create perpetual energy machines. This has led to a technological revolution here, with effectively free mechanical energy being used to power everything from water pumps to mechanical guardians. Xelsoan is a metropolitan place - probably the most well-mixed country in all of Arcadia, and practically every even semi-civilized race is represented here. This mixing of people, ideas, and plentiful energy has allowed Xelsoan to be one of the most socially and technologically advanced countries in Arcadia.  

## The People
In the Arcadian setting, some Ancestries have slightly different lore than as written in the **Draw Steel: Heroes** book.  Additionally, there are some extra Ancestries that one could choose.

### [[Devil]]
Largely as default.  There are enough Devils on Arcadia that are second, third, or later generation native Arcadians that most people do not assume a given Devil has any connection to the [[Seven Cities of Hell]].  Found all throughout Arcadia.
### Dragon Knight ([[Dragonkin]])
Rather than a result of a ritual, Dragonkin are a normal, if slowly breeding species.  Mostly isolated to the [[Frostlands]], many Arcadians go their whole life without seeing a Dragonkin.
### [[Dwarf]]
As book default.  Found primarily in Brunhild, and Pyrrhus
### [[Wode Elf]]
Largely as book default.  In modern times, the Wode Elves of [[Silvius]] are no longer reclusive or known for 'snatching children'.  
### [[High Elf]]
Associated primarily with [[Thellonde]], the high elves of Arcadia are the originators of the ritual capable of creation of [[Deathless]].  
### [[Hakaan]]
Largely as written.  Found primarily in the Frostlands
### [[Humans]]
As written.  Found Everywhere.
### [[Memonek]]
Mostly as written, but extremely rare.  The Memonek were unknown a century ago, but have been appearing with more and more frequency.  Often appear in Arcadia proper because they were sent on a specific quest by "higher beings"
### [[Orc]]
Largely as written.  Orcs are a people in diaspora, forming communities within all the various countries. Once leaders of the [[Baranthean Empire]], before it's fall.
### [[Polder]]
Polder are not as well integrated in human societies, being more closely intertwined with dwarfish society.  There are Polder groups everywhere, but the largest is in Brunhild, followed closely by Pyrrhus.
### [[Revenant]] (but also [[Deathless]])
A true Revenant is rare, but do exist in Arcadia.  Significantly more common are the Deathless of Thellonde, which are commonly "created" by ritual by the government there.  See the Deathless page for details.  Both use the same ancestry rules.  Deathless from ancestries that are not High Elfs are rare.
### [[Time Raider]]
Time Raiders are currently unknown on Arcadia, though there are a few places they could appear.  If you wish to play a Time Raider, ask!

[[Catfolk]]
The Catfolk of Arcadia are known for their shrewd business sense and are most commonly found in [[Xelsoan]]
