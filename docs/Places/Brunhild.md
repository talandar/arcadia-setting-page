Brunhild is a continent where the surface is constantly blasted by lightning, resulting in the clans of Dwarves and Polder here bunkering down in sprawling cavern cities dug out of the rock of the continent.  Within, they research, and brew, and drink, and generally push the overall level of technological innovation of Arcadia forward, one explosion at a time.

### Demography and Population

50% [[Dwarf]], 30% [[Polder]], 10% Goblinoid, 10% Other
The people of Brunhild are a hard working, industrious lot, especially since the [[Chargestone]]-fueled industrial revolution several hundred years ago. During the day, forges are stoked, research is done, and alcohol is brewed. At night, the people here enjoy the fruits of their labors, drinking and partying. Then they repeat the whole thing over the next day. Unfortunately, mixing the large reserves of chargestone power and experimental technology with drinking and partying often leads to accidental building demolition, fireworks, or more often, thick black columns of smoke. The next morning, the people all pitch in together to get the affected property owner back into working shape. The clan mentality helps here, as even those not responsible for the destruction help with the rebuild. It is usually only a matter of hours or days before any destroyed building is back to functional - and probably better than it was the first time.

### Government Structure

Brunhild has a two-level representative democracy system. Towns, Villages, Cities and the like each have a council of clans that meets locally to handle local affairs. From each of these councils, a representative is elected and sent to [[Gareholm]] to represent them in the Great Council. The Great Council votes on matters of state and external affairs, weighing each vote by the size of the population center represented.

### Military

Brunhild's Military is a "Purely Defensive Force" to hear the Great Council speak of it.  Brunhild's cities, being almost uniformly underground, are extremely defensible, and the people in general have very little appetite for fighting.  The force of Brunhild is significantly smaller than those of most other countries, but more elite, and their war-airships have more firepower and are better armored than those built elsewhere.

### Religion
[[Artrix]] is the most worshipped of the major gods here, their portfolio of learning and magic fitting well with the enthusiastic researchers of Brunhild.


### Agriculture & Industry

Brunhild's Industry is primarily based on chargestone - the production and charging of it, and the subsequent use of it to power complex, powerful machines. Chargestone acts quite a bit like a battery, allowing electric engines, powerful new types of weapons, and other impressive new technologies. The export of chargestones is profitable, but limited, as the government wishes to ensure that Brunhild retains the competitive advantage of cheap, easy electrical power. Powered by the chargestone, Brunhild is a technological powerhouse, creating impressive new kinds of weapons, ships, and devices to make life easier. Brunhild's minor industries are metals and alcohol. The rocky, mountainous terrain holds significant deposits of some rare metals, Adamantine and Mithril, plus the more valuable base metals, like Silver and Gold, and the people of Brunhild are avid brewers. Some of the best drinks in the world are brewed here.

### Education

Brunhild's strong social support systems ensure a high level of education is available to every Brunhildi child.  Upper education is via either formal colleges in the larger cities of Brunhild, or through apprenticeships with those working in the desired industry.

### Technological Level

One of the most technologically advanced countries in Arcadia, Brunhild holds a monopolistic edge on chargestone, and therefore, electrically powered conveniences.  Although many of the most popular chargestone tools are replicable with [[Crystal Ritual]] magic, the chargestone version is simpler and easier for the average person to use.
