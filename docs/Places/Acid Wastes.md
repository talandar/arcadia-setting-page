#### Abandoned Penitentiary
This magically reinforced stone and metal building hides an entrance to a surprisingly deep cave system within the rocks of the Acid Wastes.  The cave system is dug out in such a way as to be part maze, part prison.  Research done to determine the age of the penitentiary returns dates that vary from 300 to about 600 [[Arcadian Timeline|BC]].
