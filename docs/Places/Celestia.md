### Demography and Population

37% Human, 22% Polder, 18% Elf, 10% Dwarf, 13% Other. Celestia is a fairly well mixed country, with representatives from many races, including some of the more monstrous races. Many of the more powerful temples ([[Pyros]] , [[Yrrasil]] and [[Imera]], in particular) teach their followers to be accepting of others, so these godly lands are quite accepting of all who live here.

### Government Structure

Until quite recently, the Celestian government was a two-house system where a Circle of mages were one house, while the other held elected officials of the various churches.  The notably divergent desires of these two groups caused constant deadlock and a generally weak country that had trouble getting anything done.  After decades of their government being largely useless, the frustration of the people of Celestia finally boiled over two years ago in a revolution that is still ongoing.  The mages of The Circle have largely fled Celestia for more welcoming lands, while the churches attempt to hold what power they can while weathering the people's ire.  The People's Rebellion is starting to cool, now that the members of The Circle have left, leaving the leaders of the rebellion to figure out how to lead an actual country.

### Military

Even before the People's Rebellion, the Celestian army was weak, and The Rebellion has further weakened Celestian military power.  Perhaps thankfully, Celestia is poor in natural resources, and there's very little reason for other nations to take advantage of the current state of disarray.

### Religion

All the major gods, and the majority of the less important gods of Arcadia keep their center of power here.  The most devout worshipers of the various churches are found here or travel here in order to rise up the ranks of their church.  Walking the streets of the larger Celstian towns can be an overwhelming affair, as it is extremely common for street corners to be occupied by preachers attempting to convert passers by to whatever deity they worship.  This has been less common in recent years, as the fall of the previous government means the churches are less in contention with each other to secure votes in the conclave of churches.


### Agriculture & Industry

Celestian lands are not particularly suitable for farming.  The rocky soil here is poor in nutrients, but rich in minerals both magical and mundane.  Mining is one of the prime industries, and the magical materials that come from Celestia's quarries often stay in-nation to be sent to the churches to make magical or holy objects that are then sold off for a high premium.  Celestian healing potions, for example, are the standard against which those crafted elsewhere are judged.

### Education

Celestian education follows a reasonably familiar model:  free state mandated lower education, and a system of self-paid higher education institutions.  Celestians out of the state mandated lower education system are ready to enter many available jobs, and the system does a good job of finding those with, for example, innate magical talents, or the like.

### Technological Level

Technologically, Celestia is behind in some areas - without the natural magical environment for something like for [[Wound Spring]]s from [[Xelsoan]], or [[Chargestone]] from [[Brunhild]], Celestia largely gets by on [[Crystal Ritual]] magic and technological imports.
