### Demography and Population

37% Human, 22% Polder, 18% Elf, 10% Dwarf, 13% Other. Celestia is a fairly well mixed country, with representatives from many races, including some of the more monstrous races. Many of the more powerful temples ([[Pyros]] , [[Yrrasil]] and [[Imera]], in particular) teach their followers to be accepting of others, so these godly lands are quite accepting of all who live here.

### Government Structure

Until quite recently, the Celestian government was a two-house system where a Circle of mages were one house, while the other held elected officials of the various churches.  The notably divergent desires of these two groups caused constant deadlock and a generally weak country that had trouble getting anything done.  After decades of their government being largely useless, the frustration of the people of Celestia finally boiled over two years ago in a revolution that is still ongoing.  The mages of The Circle have largely fled Celestia for more welcoming lands, while the churches attempt to hold what power they can while weathering the people's ire.  The People's Rebellion is starting to cool, now that the members of The Circle have left, leaving the leaders of the rebellion to figure out how to lead an actual country.

### Military

Even before the People's Rebellion, the Celestian army was weak, and The Rebellion has further weakened Celestian military power.  Perhaps thankfully, Celestia is poor in natural resources, and there's very little reason for other nations to take advantage of the current state of disarray.

### Religion
All the major gods, and the majority of the less important gods of Arcadia keep their center of power here.  The most devout worshippers of the various churches are found here or travel here in order to rise up the ranks of their church.
