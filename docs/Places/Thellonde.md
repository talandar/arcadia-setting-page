Thellonde is a powerful elvish kingdom that lives in a land where the dead occasionally rise from their graves if not properly handled. The people here are known as skilled craftsmen and artists. Thellonde claims to have "conquered death", with the ritual that allows them to raise the honored dead as [[Deathless]].  These deathless retain their personality and selves, but do not age. Thellonde can raise a significant army at a moments notice though the use of these deathless, making them possibly the most militarily powerful nation in Arcadia.

### Demography and Population

80% [[High Elf]], 10% [[Human]],10% Other (About 10% of the High Elf population is deathless.)   Thellonde is a society where the living and dead co-mingle in peace. The high quantity of Deathless here has led to a society that is very accepting of death and the undead. The common folk of Thellonde count themselves lucky if they have a deathless ancestor or friend to advise them, and noble families usually have several deathless ancestors who advise the current heads of house and maintain traditions and ceremony.

### Government Structure

Thellonde is a hereditary monarchy, with a ruling bloodline unbroken for centuries. The Alathil family rules as kings and queens, and is advised by The Undying Council, a group of more than twenty deathless former kings and queens of Thellonde. Besides them, there are the Noble houses - families that have rendered some exceptional service to the crown.  The  current queen of Thellonde is [[Ellarial Alathil]]

### Military

The Fist of Thellonde is likely the most powerful single military force on Arcadia, as they are able to draw upon significant deathless reserves within days of battle breaking out.  Beneath the capitol of [[Highmount]], there is an enormous crypt complex, where there reside thousands of inert Deathless, who have taken the "Black Shard" option. Technically, the military has no political power, and receives orders from the monarchy directly, but they do have significant social influence.
##### The Black Shard
This social program is nominally meant to help uplift families, but is a large driver of the size of the Thell military.  An individual pledges themselves to the Fist of Thellonde, and is willingly turned deathless.  They then inter themselves in the crypts, setting aside the black shard within reach, but not within touch.  The family draws a stipend from the "work" of the resting Deathless, and the deathless awaits the call of battle.

### Religion

Religion is important in Thellonde, but not a daily part of life for most people. Many worship [[Imera]], but worship of smaller gods is fairly common.  Generally, people here are devout enough keep the rites and holidays, but not much more. Many in Thellonde practice something akin to ancestor worship, though no particular ancestor receives enough worship to ascend to godhood.

### Agriculture & Industry

Thellonde is known for both gemstone mines and extremely skilled craftsmen. The mines of Thellonde are rich in gems, but do not have an appreciable quantity of metals. The craftsmen are renowned for their skill in woodworking, particularly furniture, and jewelry crafting.  An heirloom table from Thellonde can be safely assumed to last many generations.

### Education

There are two classes of education within Thellonde. Noble born and the children of well-to-do merchants often retain the services of a tutor or tutors. Otherwise, the upper-class children will often attend a private boarding school where they are educated in both the practical (math, sciences, magic) and the less practical (courtly behavior, etc). Children of lesser means enroll in a royally-mandated public schooling system, which usually does an adequate job of preparing the children for their lives.

### Technological Level

Thellonde is known for artisans and craftsmen, not researchers, but this ignores Thellonde's deep research into ritual magic. The ritualists in Thellonde are very powerful, but keep their knowledge secret. The ritual allowing creation of a Deathless, for example, is tightly held, and there are whispers that the Deathless Ritual isn't even the most impressive arcane feat developed here.
