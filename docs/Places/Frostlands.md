The Frostlands are made up of not so much islands as glaciers or icebergs. The blue icy elemental crystal causes nearly constant snowfall, which almost never melts, accumulating in drifts, and needing to be shoveled out of the towns. The frostlands are a tribal peoples, and only in the last several years have they begun unifying into a real nation.

### Demography and Population

50% [[Dragonkin]], 30% [[Hakaan]], 20% Other
Largely the home of Dragonkin and Hakaan, the Frostlands are a tribal peoples, mostly living in villages less than two hundred people. The various villages of the Frostlands love festivals, and often throwing a festival means not just a party for those of the village, but also of those from nearby villages. This helps keep relations friendly and promotes trade between villages.

### Government Structure

In recent years, the people of the Frostlands have begun to unify under the chief of the tribe that lived on [[Fishtooth Mountain]],  [[Hadren Greyscale]], a charismatic Dragonkin that rose to prominence rather suddenly.  She has been working on unifying the various tribes of the Frostlands under a single banner, partially on the hopes of establishing diplomatic and trade relations with the rest of Arcadia.
### Military

The Frostlands lack a standing military of any sort.  Each tribe largely defends itself from the threats of monsters separately.

### Religion

People of the Frostlands often revere minor gods of ice, hunting/fishing, or the like. Usually a village will have a shrine or two, but nothing extravagant. For the people of the Frostlands, religion is less important than survival - though the holy days of the gods provide ample opportunities for festivals.

### Agriculture & Industry

The various tribes of the frostlands mostly make their livings ice fishing, trading with outsiders, and small farms. Most more complicated industries are small or not present at all.

### Education

There is no formal education system in the Frostlands.  The children of a tribe are often taught together in one large class by an elder of the tribe.
