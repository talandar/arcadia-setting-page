### Days And Months
The Calendar in Arcadia is set with eight months of exactly 30 days.  Between each month is a non-numbered festival day, leading to a year of 248 days.

Different cultures in Arcadia care more or less about the various festival days, and observe them in their own ways.  For example, [[Pyrrhus]] celebrates the Summer's End Season Change Festival at the end of Summer quite a bit, as it marks the end of the worst of the heat there.  On the other hand, Silvius celebrates most strongly the Spring Festival, as it marks the start of the planting season and the start of new life.
