Arcadian Airships are kept aloft by the very same [[Elemental Crystal]]s that keep the islands floating.  

Unfortunately, this provides lift only, and not propulsion.  This leaves quite a bit of leeway for the various countries and shipyards to put their own spin on how to move the airship.

[[Pyrrhus]] in particular, is a fan of bound fire or air elementals, which form a ring around the ship and acts somewhat as a jet engine (as airships from the Eberron  D&D setting) ![[20210523_205306.jpg]] 
While Xelsoan-based airships carefully manipulate gravity for the hull, and hull only, of the ship, allowing for a quite comfortable ride and a more "Traditional" look.

Some lower-cost airships use sails and masts, as we would expect of sailing (water) ships.

In general, however, a ship can be of most shapes and sizes, from two to three person skiffs, to warships requiring dozens of crewmembers to sail effectively.  The various shipyards have tells as to their construction, and one can usually spot where a ship is from based on it's design.

In practice, airships are extremely safe.  The magic of the Elemental Crystal keeps them afloat with every minimal maintenance, and most ships have secondary sails or propulsion methods to get to a port in case of emergency.  Hundreds and hundreds of airships fill the skies of Arcadia, shipping goods, transporting people, and, sometimes, ferrying adventurers from one crisis to the next.
