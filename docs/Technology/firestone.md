Firestone is a slightly-glowing, deep-red rocky ore mined in the mountains of [[Pyrrhus]].  It is dangerous to mine, thanks to the flammability of the raw ore.  Mining and refinement of Firestone is one of the cornerstones of Pyrrhan economics.

### Raw Firestone
This deep red ore is akin to coal, burning slowly and releasing large quantities of heat.  It is used around Arcadia for heat, to power steam contraptions, or occasionally, on particularly cheap airships, as a means of providing propulsion.  It is mostly safe to store, as it requires quite a bit of heat to start burning.
### Refined Firestone
This black-and-red powder has many of the properties of black powder (gunpowder).  It burns at a rapid rate, and if compressed, produces quite a powerful explosion.  Unlike gunpowder, however, it needs no oxidizer, and will explode or catch fire even underwater.  Barrels of refined firestone are almost always non-sparking metal, not wood, and are kept very carefully to prevent disaster, as an errant spark or flame could send the whole barrel up quite energetically.
